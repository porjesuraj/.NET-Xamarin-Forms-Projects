# Sample Template

This is the sample template... are you adding a new template to the sample repo? Use the files in this folder to get started.

Be sure to update the Display Name on iOS, Android, & UWP to be relevent for what your sample is. Note that the Android/iOS id should always start with `com.prismlibrary` however you should update the final segment of the id so that someone may have multiple samples installed side by side on their device.

Before checking in your sample be sure to update this ReadMe with some relevent notes about the sample
